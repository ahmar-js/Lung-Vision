# Lung Vision

LungVision is a transformative, AI-powered initiative aimed at revolutionizing early lung cancer detection through the integration of multi-modal data. The platform fuses imaging data (PET/CT) and molecular biomarkers to enhance diagnostic accuracy via deep learning. Central to LungVision is a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that performs both classification (malignancy detection) and regression (risk scoring), providing real-time, explainable insights to assist clinicians at the point of care.
